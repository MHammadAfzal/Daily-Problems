# This code is checking if the current script is being run as the main program (as opposed to being
# imported as a module into another program). If it is being run as the main program, it will print
# "Hello, World" to the console. This is a common way to include test code or example code in a module
# that can be run directly for testing or demonstration purposes.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Hello, World")
